<h1>About</h1>

<img id="about-headshot" src="//files.mcclimon.org/img/headshot.jpg" alt="headshot"/>
<p>My name is Michael, and this is my website. I’m a Ph.D. student by
day/night, and a computer programmer (mostly) by day. I live in Bloomington,
Indiana with my wife and two cats. I’m into a lot of things: music theory,
computer programming, jazz, hacker culture, text editing, hip culture,
Schenkerian theory and analysis, math, and learning new things. You can read
about some of the things I’ve done on the <a href="projects.html">projects
  page</a>.</p>

<h2>About this site</h2>

<p>This site, <a href="http://www.mcclimon.org">www.mcclimon.org</a>, is
hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. It’s now a static site
generated with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> (that seems to be what the hacker
community is into
these days), after former stints in Ruby, Perl, and PHP.
I write primarily in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>,
which makes it very easy to actually <em>write</em> for the web rather than
spending all my time with markup.</p>

<p>The serifed body font on this website is the open-source
<a href="http://junicode.sourceforge.net/">Junicode</a>. The sans-serif in the header is PT Sans
Narrow, from the folks over at <a href="http://www.paratype.com">Paratype</a>.
PT Sans is hosted on <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/">Google web
    fonts</a>, and Junicodes is available on their website.</p>

<p>The design inspiration for the site comes primarily from
<a href="http://www.indiana.edu">IU’s</a> crimson and cream, which is (sports
affiliations aside) a nice color scheme. The grey (gray?) is a neutral
background, and the cream container is easier on the eyes than stark white.</p>

<p>I write on my iMac running OS 10.9, though occasionally I’ll use my
Toshiba NB305 (a tiny little netbook running <a href="http://crunchbang.org">Crunchbang Linux
</a> at the moment). After brief stints with TextMate,
Sublime Text, and Emacs (shudder), I use <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a> full time
now. (I actually like some things about Emacs, actually...Emacs Lisp is way
nicer than Vimscript!) You can see my dotfiles on
<a href="https://github.com/mmcclimon/dotfiles">GitHub</a>, if you&#39;re into that sort of
thing.</p>
