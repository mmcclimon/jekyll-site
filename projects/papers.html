<h3>Jazz Harmony, Transformations, and ii–V Space (2012)</h3>
<p>Studies of jazz harmony in recent years have primarily taken the form of Schenkerian analyses that seek to uncover large-scale voice-leading structures to define tonality. Some theorists disagree on exactly how Schenkerian techniques should be applied to jazz, but hardly anyone, however, seems to doubt that Schenkerian techniques are the best way to examine jazz’s tonal structures. While I am certainly not opposed to Schenkerian techniques, using them as the only tool for jazz harmonic analysis misses some important aspects of the music at hand. With a few notable exceptions (people like Bill Evans or Brad Mehldau, for instance), jazz musicians conceive of the music harmonically, rather than linearly. As a gentle corrective to this situation, the present paper presents a transformational model that, while not totally devoid of voice-leading considerations, shifts attention back to harmony as a primary way of understanding jazz. While on the surface a transformational model may seem just as abstract as Schenkerian analysis, harmony in jazz fits in quite well with David Lewin‘s famous “transformational attitude.” A jazz musician does not think of chords as series of Cartesian points, but rather as a series of “characteristic gestures” between them. Tellingly, they do not refer to a piece‘s harmonic structure as “the chords,” but rather as “the changes.”</p>

<p>The most common harmonic progression in jazz is undoubtedly the ii<sup>7</sup>–V<sup>7</sup>–I<sup>7</sup> progression (hereafter, ii–V–I, or often, simply ii–V). It is the first progression taught in most jazz method books, and the only small-scale progression to have an entire Aebersold play-along volume dedicated to it. The progression is so prevalent that many jazz musicians describe tunes in terms of their constituent ii–Vs; such a musician might describe the bridge of “All the Things You Are” as being simply “ii–V to G, ii–V to E, then V–I in F.” While some theorists are quick to dismiss this kind of description for lacking rigor, in this paper I take the way jazz musicians actually think about the music they play as a starting point for developing a more rigorous transformational approach to jazz harmony. This paper begins by outlining the basics of what I will call “ii–V space,” compares this space with other models of jazz harmony along with other transformational approaches, and finally two analyses to illustrate the utility of ii–V space for jazz analysis. (Examples for this paper available <a href="/ii-V/">here</a>.)</p>

<h3>Projecting the Grid: A Preliminary Study of Metrical Induction in Solo Jazz Piano Introductions (2011)</h3>
<p>Building on my study of Monk‘s “Evidence,” this paper attempts to create a set of preference rules for how listeners understand the creation of meter in solo jazz piano introductions. This represents the first stages of what I imagine will become a much larger project, and is by no means meant to be a complete study of the phenomenon of metrical induction in jazz.</p>

<h3>Expressing the Inexpressible: Thelonious Monk‘s “Crepuscule with Nellie” (2010)</h3>
<p>While few doubt the expressive potential of jazz music, this topic has not been well explored by music theorists. While many jazz musicians and authors talk
    about “creating a story” with their improvisations the question of expression in original jazz composition is simply overlooked. Building on Robert Hatten‘s theories of
    markedness and musical agency along with Garrett Michaelson‘s topical approach to jazz “grooves," I use Thelonious Monk‘s “Crepuscule with Nellie” as a case study for the
    examination of musical meaning in jazz composition.</p>
<p>“Crepuscule with Nellie” provides an ideal sample for this type of inquiry. Monk wrote the piece in May of 1957 while his wife, Nellie, was in the hospital having her thyroid
    removed. It is a unique piece in Monk‘s output (and unusual for jazz in general) in that it was never played with any improvisation; the piece was simply the “head" of the tune,
    with no solos. Monk felt that the composition should stand alone, as a kind of concerto written for his wife. My paper asks the obvious question: What is it about this work
    that makes it somehow too intimate to be commented on, by Monk or anyone else? A thorough analysis of this work helps to illuminate how a consideration of expressive meaning
    can enhance our understanding of both Monk‘s unique style and, more generally, the art of jazz expression.</p>

<h3>The Temporal Importance of Scale Degree 5 in Schubert‘s C Major Piano Sonata, D.279/ii (2010)</h3>
<p> This paper takes a close look at the second movement of one of Schubert‘s early piano sonatas, with an eye toward its interesting temporal aspects. With a combination of historically-informed sources like Danuta Mirka‘s <i>Metric Manipulations in the Music of Haydn and Mozart</i> and Schenkerian voice-leading sketches I am able to uncover some interesting rhythmic/metric features of this otherwise highly regular Classical-style work.</p>

<h3>Examinining “Evidence”: An Inquiry into Thelonious Monk‘s Metrical Process (2010)</h3>
<p>Though rhythm is one of the most important elements of jazz, the underlying metrical structure is often taken for granted. In most of the scholarly literature on jazz rhythm the meter is seen only as a background on which other, more rhythmically interesting ideas unfold. While it is true that a majority of what may be called “common- practice jazz” (swing through bebop) is in common time, how this meter is established is often overlooked. As a means of beginning to address the issue of meter (as opposed to rhythm) in jazz, this paper provides an analysis of one of Thelonious Monk‘s most metrically complex pieces, “Evidence.”</p>
<p>Monk‘s “Evidence” is particularly suited to such a study: its melody is sparse and pointillistic, and most recordings feature a solo piano introduction with no other rhythm section members helping to clarify the meter. In this paper, I use Christopher Hasty‘s (1997) approach to emergent meter to examine how the expected 4/4 meter is uniquely created in this piece. Given the primacy of common time and the high degree of syncopation in jazz, Hasty‘s emphasis on varying projection lengths seems superfluous for listeners already entrained to a meter. Rather, the entrained jazz listener is more likely to experience meter as a fixed background on which many varied rhythmic events take place. Hence, my analytical model begins with Hasty‘s approach, and then turns to Lerdahl and Jackendoff‘s (1983) metrical grid once the meter is firmly established. By examining “Evidence,” I hope to show that neither of these approaches provides a complete picture of metrical structure, but that a combination of both can serve as a starting point for addressing the issue of meter in jazz.</p>
